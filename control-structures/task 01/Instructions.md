# Task 3.1: Temperature conversion

Create a new Temperature class and add a main method to the class. Then ensure that the class provides the following
functionality:

- Read a floating-point number from the keyboard (e.g. Double.parseDouble())
- Convert the input number into Fahrenheit.
- Output the result

Sample output:

```
Please enter a temperature in degrees Celsius:
37.0
37.0 degrees Celsius correspond to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
```

The following ratio applies for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit:

Fahrenheit = 9/5 * Celsius + 32

:zap: Keep in mind that 9 and 5 are interpreted as integers, and thus integer division is also performed. What are the
different ways to solve this problem? Please refer to **GoodToKnow - Casting** within the live exercise section of 
week 2 in the learning campus.
